# Hey there — I’m Joy 👋

I’m a frontend developer who loves building things that people can actually use. I’m passionate about learning new technologies, solving problems, and sharing what I discover along the way.

Over time, I’ve explored React.js, Next.js, Vue.js, and Tailwind CSS, and recently I’ve been diving deeper into UI/UX, TypeScript, DSA, and building scalable web applications.

*When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me watching anime, sipping coffee, hanging out with cats, or exploring one of the many hobbies I seem to collect along the way. You could say I’m a creature of many interests. 🐾☕*

## 🚀 What I Do

Right now, I spend most of my time working with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, crafting interfaces that are both functional and enjoyable to use.

I love building responsive, dynamic web apps that put user experience first — from dashboards and reusable components to seamless API integrations and product features.

I’m constantly exploring new frameworks, tools, and animation libraries, always looking for ways to push my skills a little further.

```
// example: AboutMeCard.jsx
import React from "react";

export default function AboutMeCard() {
  return (
    <div className="max-w-sm mx-auto p-6 bg-white rounded-xl shadow-md text-center">
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Hi, I’m Joy 👋</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        I’m a frontend developer who loves <strong>React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS</strong> — and I’m always learning!
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        When I’m not coding, you’ll find me <em>watching anime, drinking coffee, or hanging out with cats</em>.
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 💜 What I Love

I love solving tricky frontend problems, experimenting with new libraries, and learning from the projects I build — even when things don’t go as planned.
The process of learning, iterating, and improving keeps me grounded and excited about what’s next.

Beyond code, I care deeply about UI/UX, exploring how to make digital experiences more human, thoughtful, and accessible.

Some things that drive me:

- Turning complex UI challenges into simple, elegant solutions.

- Writing clean, maintainable code that others can easily build on.

- Documenting my learning journey as a reflection of growth.

- Sharing insights through blogs, GitHub projects, and tutorials.

## ✨ Why I’m Blogging

This space is for **documenting my learning**, sharing the projects I’m working on, and hopefully helping others who are on a similar journey. It’s all about growth—mine and hopefully yours too.

Lately, I’ve also been trying to **rediscover the spark** that once kept me up late, experimenting with code for fun. Writing and creating again feels like a way to reconnect with that part of myself.

This blog is about sharing what I learn and reigniting the **joy**😉, curiosity, and creativity that can fade when life gets busy. Here’s to learning, rebuilding, and finding that spark again.

So, this blog is about growth, reflection, and rebuilding joy — in code, in design, and in the everyday process of learning.

If you’re a fellow developer, designer, or curious mind, I’d love to connect. Let’s learn, create, and explore new ideas together.

Thanks for stopping by — I can’t wait to share what’s next! 🚀
