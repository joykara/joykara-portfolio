# Rediscovering the Spark

Sometimes, inspiration isn’t lost — it’s just buried under routine.  
Lately, I’ve been diving back into **design tools**, re-exploring **UI motion**, and experimenting with **interactive layouts**.

## 🎨 Playing With Visuals

Here’s one of my favorite practice sessions — a simple layout rebuild:

Even though I’ve coded dozens of interfaces, this one reminded me how _design and motion_ can reignite curiosity.

## 💻 Experimenting With Motion

I also revisited some small animations with **Framer Motion**:

```jsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

export default function SparkButton() {
  return (
    <motion.button
      whileHover={{ scale: 1.1 }}
      whileTap={{ scale: 0.9 }}
      className="px-4 py-2 bg-indigo-600 text-white rounded-md"
    >
      Hover me!
    </motion.button>
  );
}
```
